# The Interceptor Alpha
Introducing The Interceptor - the ultimate browser extension for Ethereum! Say goodbye to the confusion of making transactions with our intuitive tool that provides clear explanations of the type of Ethereum transactions you're making. The Interceptor can be used alongside with Metamask or as a standalone transaction simulation tool. With Metamask integration, you can easily send transactions by forwarding them for signing. But what really sets The Interceptor apart is its Simulation Mode. This powerful feature allows you to simulate multiple transactions and see exactly what they will do - even using DApps for free! Our extension is currently available on Chrome, Firefox, and Brave, and supports Ethereum Mainnet, Sepolia and GÃ¶rli networks. Experience seamless Ethereum transactions like never before with The Interceptor.

Install for [Firefox](https://github.com/DarkFlorist/TheInterceptor/releases/download/v0.0.25/TheInterceptor-firefox-v0.0.25.xpi) or [Chrome](https://www.dark.florist/google-chrome-install)

# Features
- Simulation mode, send transactions for free and see what they do

# Privacy
Your privacy is our priority. The Interceptor is purpose-built to minimize data leakage: no external queries are made without direct user input. By default, it connects to Ethereum RPC nodes operated by [Dark Florists (us)](https://www.dark.florist/), though you can configure it to connect to other RPC nodes if desired. Please note, The Interceptor requires RPC nodes that support the mandatory `eth_simulateV1` endpoint, currently available in Geth and Nethermind.
