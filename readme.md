# The Interceptor Alpha
Introducing The Interceptor - the ultimate browser extension for Ethereum! Say goodbye to the confusion of making transactions with our intuitive tool that provides clear explanations of the type of Ethereum transactions you're making. The Interceptor can be used alongside with Metamask or as a standalone transaction simulation tool. With Metamask integration, you can easily send transactions by forwarding them for signing. But what really sets The Interceptor apart is its Simulation Mode. This powerful feature allows you to simulate multiple transactions and see exactly what they will do - even using DApps for free! Our extension is currently available on Chrome, Firefox, and Brave, and supports Ethereum Mainnet, Sepolia and GÃ¶rli networks. Experience seamless Ethereum transactions like never before with The Interceptor.

Install for [Firefox](https://github.com/DarkFlorist/TheInterceptor/releases/download/v0.0.25/TheInterceptor-firefox-v0.0.25.xpi) or [Chrome](https://www.dark.florist/google-chrome-install)

# Features
- Simulation mode, send transactions for free and see what they do

- And more!

# Privacy
We value your privacy highly. The Interceptor is designed to minimize privacy leakage: We don't query external sites for anything. However, The Interceptor Alpha is currently connecting to Ethereum RPC nodes operated by [Dark Florists (us)](https://www.dark.florist/) because we utilize some custom tooling on the backend. Work is underway to get our custom tooling standardized across clients so Interceptor will work with any standards compliant Ethereum client.
