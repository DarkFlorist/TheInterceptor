/** Semaphores are initialized with a number of permits that get aquired and released
 * over the lifecycle of the semaphore. These permits limit the number of simultaneous
 * executions of the code that the semaphore synchronizes. Functions can wait on a semaphore
 * and stop executing until a permit becomes available.
 *
 * Locks are a special case of semaphores that only allow one execution of a critical section.
 * If you need a lock, you can import the Lock class from this package.
 *
 * This Semaphore class is implemented with the help of promises that get returned
 * by functions that wait for permits to become available. This makes it possible
 * to use async/await to synchronize your code.
